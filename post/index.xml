      <title>Speeding up blogdown with Nginx</title>

      <description>One of my blogdown sites shows high response times on local PC (Windows 10) while serving from RStudio. To solve this problem I made Nginx config that allows you to view static content while editing blogdown project. Main change to simplest config is to disable all caching in Nginx and browser, otherwise you will not see latest changes after rendering.
Apache benchmark show response time drop from 2 seconds to 2 milliseconds.</description>

      <description>Here is very nice article The largest benchmark of Serverless providers.
And I really wait for new results which was promised to all of us in Berndâ€™s Twitter.
Read my article on @Medium about the benchmark of the biggest four #serverless providers. A new benchmark is coming soon!https://t.co/j45fA0R7i5

      <description>SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark is retired in January 2018 and replaced by the SPEC CPU 2017 suite https://www.spec.org/retired.html#cpu
What are you going to do while your faivorite CPUs are not tested in SPEC CPU 2017?
Since Estimates are allowed you can download all records as CSV and find conversion coefficient. https://www.spec.org/cgi-bin/osgresults?conf=rint2006 https://www.spec.org/cgi-bin/osgresults?conf=rint2017
